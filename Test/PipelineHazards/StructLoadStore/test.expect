=== Critical Hazards (Stalls > 0) ===
   Instruction: sw x3, 4(x4) at PC=0x4
   Depends on: lw x1, 0(x2) (PC=0x0)
   Distance: 1 instruction
   Stall cycles: 1
   Description: Structural hazard: both instructions use Memory Access Unit
   Solution: Stall pipeline until Memory Access Unit is available

   Instruction: lh x5, 8(x6) at PC=0x8
   Depends on: sw x3, 4(x4) (PC=0x4)
   Distance: 1 instruction
   Stall cycles: 1
   Description: Structural hazard: both instructions use Memory Access Unit
   Solution: Stall pipeline until Memory Access Unit is available

   Instruction: sh x7, 12(x8) at PC=0xc
   Depends on: lh x5, 8(x6) (PC=0x8)
   Distance: 1 instruction
   Stall cycles: 1
   Description: Structural hazard: both instructions use Memory Access Unit
   Solution: Stall pipeline until Memory Access Unit is available


=== Resolved / Non-Critical Hazards ===
