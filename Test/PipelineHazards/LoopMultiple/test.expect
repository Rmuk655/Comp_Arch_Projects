=== Critical Hazards (Stalls > 0) ===
   Instruction: add x2, x2, x3 at PC=0xc
   Depends on: lw x3, 0(x4) (PC=0x8)
   Distance: 1 instruction
   Register: x3   Stall cycles: 1
   Description: RAW Hazard: Read-after-Write on x3
   Solution: 1 cycle stall or forwarding

   Instruction: bne x1, x0, loop at PC=0x18
   Stall cycles: 2
   Description: Control hazard from Branch instruction: bne
   Solution: Use branch prediction or delayed branching (2 cycles)


=== Resolved / Non-Critical Hazards ===
   Instruction: addi x1, x1, -1 at PC=0x14
   Depends on: addi x1, x0, 10 (PC=0x0)
   Distance: 5 instructions
   Register: x1   Stall cycles: 0
   Note: Hazard resolved by separation or forwarding
   Description: RAW Hazard: Read-after-Write on x1
   Solution: No stall needed (forwarding available)

   Instruction: addi x1, x1, -1 at PC=0x14
   Depends on: addi x1, x0, 10 (PC=0x0)
   Distance: 5 instructions
   Register: x1   Stall cycles: 0
   Note: WAW hazard resolved by instruction separation or writeback timing
   Description: WAW Hazard: Write-after-Write on x1
   Solution: Reorder writes or stall to avoid overwriting

   Instruction: bne x1, x0, loop at PC=0x18
   Depends on: addi x1, x0, 10 (PC=0x0)
   Distance: 6 instructions
   Register: x1   Stall cycles: 0
   Note: Hazard resolved by separation or forwarding
   Description: RAW Hazard: Read-after-Write on x1
   Solution: No stall needed (forwarding available)

   Instruction: add x2, x2, x3 at PC=0xc
   Depends on: addi x2, x0, 0 (PC=0x4)
   Distance: 2 instructions
   Register: x2   Stall cycles: 0
   Note: Hazard resolved by separation or forwarding
   Description: RAW Hazard: Read-after-Write on x2
   Solution: No stall needed (forwarding available)

   Instruction: add x2, x2, x3 at PC=0xc
   Depends on: addi x2, x0, 0 (PC=0x4)
   Distance: 2 instructions
   Register: x2   Stall cycles: 0
   Note: WAW hazard resolved by instruction separation or writeback timing
   Description: WAW Hazard: Write-after-Write on x2
   Solution: Reorder writes or stall to avoid overwriting

   Instruction: addi x4, x4, 4 at PC=0x10
   Depends on: lw x3, 0(x4) (PC=0x8)
   Distance: 2 instructions
   Register: x4   Stall cycles: 0
   Note: Hazard resolved by separation or forwarding
   Description: WAR Hazard: Write-after-Read on x4
   Solution: No stall needed (no conflict or handled by reordering)

   Instruction: bne x1, x0, loop at PC=0x18
   Depends on: addi x1, x1, -1 (PC=0x14)
   Distance: 1 instruction
   Register: x1   Stall cycles: 0
   Note: Hazard resolved by separation or forwarding
   Description: RAW Hazard: Read-after-Write on x1
   Solution: No stall needed (forwarding available)
