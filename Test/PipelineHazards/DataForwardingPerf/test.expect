=== Critical Hazards (Stalls > 0) ===
   Instruction: add x8, x6, x9 at PC=0xc
   Depends on: lw x6, 0(x7) (PC=0x8)
   Distance: 1 instruction
   Register: x6   Stall cycles: 1
   Description: RAW Hazard: Read-after-Write on x6
   Solution: 1 cycle stall or forwarding


=== Resolved / Non-Critical Hazards ===
   Instruction: sub x4, x1, x5 at PC=0x4
   Depends on: add x1, x2, x3 (PC=0x0)
   Distance: 1 instruction
   Register: x1   Stall cycles: 0
   Note: Hazard resolved by separation or forwarding
   Description: RAW Hazard: Read-after-Write on x1
   Solution: No stall needed (forwarding available)

   Instruction: mul x10, x1, x11 at PC=0x10
   Depends on: add x1, x2, x3 (PC=0x0)
   Distance: 4 instructions
   Register: x1   Stall cycles: 0
   Note: Hazard resolved by separation or forwarding
   Description: RAW Hazard: Read-after-Write on x1
   Solution: No stall needed (forwarding available)
