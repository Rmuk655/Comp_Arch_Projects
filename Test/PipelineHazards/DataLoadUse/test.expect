=== Critical Hazards (Stalls > 0) ===
   Instruction: add x3, x1, x4 at PC=0x4
   Depends on: lw x1, 0(x2) (PC=0x0)
   Distance: 1 instruction
   Register: x1   Stall cycles: 1
   Description: RAW Hazard: Read-after-Write on x1
   Solution: 1 cycle stall or forwarding


=== Resolved / Non-Critical Hazards ===
   Instruction: mul x8, x1, x9 at PC=0xc
   Depends on: lw x1, 0(x2) (PC=0x0)
   Distance: 3 instructions
   Register: x1   Stall cycles: 0
   Note: Hazard resolved by separation or forwarding
   Description: RAW Hazard: Read-after-Write on x1
   Solution: No stall needed (forwarding available)
