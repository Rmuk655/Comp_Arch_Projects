=== Critical Hazards (Stalls > 0) ===
   Instruction: jalr x0, 0(x1) at PC=0x14
   Stall cycles: 2
   Description: Control hazard from Function return: jalr
   Solution: Use branch prediction or delayed branching (2 cycles)


=== Resolved / Non-Critical Hazards ===
   Instruction: jal x1, function at PC=0x4
   Depends on: add x1, x2, x3 (PC=0x0)
   Distance: 1 instruction
   Register: x1   Stall cycles: 0
   Note: WAW hazard resolved by instruction separation or writeback timing
   Description: WAW Hazard: Write-after-Write on x1
   Solution: Reorder writes or stall to avoid overwriting

   Instruction: add x4, x1, x5 at PC=0x8
   Depends on: add x1, x2, x3 (PC=0x0)
   Distance: 2 instructions
   Register: x1   Stall cycles: 0
   Note: Hazard resolved by separation or forwarding
   Description: RAW Hazard: Read-after-Write on x1
   Solution: No stall needed (forwarding available)

   Instruction: jalr x0, 0(x1) at PC=0x14
   Depends on: add x1, x2, x3 (PC=0x0)
   Distance: 5 instructions
