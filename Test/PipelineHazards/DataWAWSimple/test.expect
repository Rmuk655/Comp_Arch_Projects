   Instruction: mul x1, x7, x8 at PC=0x8
   Depends on: add x1, x2, x3 (PC=0x0)
   Distance: 2 instructions
   Register: x1   Stall cycles: 0
   Note: WAW hazard resolved by instruction separation or writeback timing
   Description: WAW Hazard: Write-after-Write on x1
   Solution: Reorder writes or stall to avoid overwriting

   Instruction: or x9, x1, x10 at PC=0xc
   Depends on: add x1, x2, x3 (PC=0x0)
   Distance: 3 instructions
   Register: x1   Stall cycles: 0
   Note: Hazard resolved by separation or forwarding
   Description: RAW Hazard: Read-after-Write on x1
   Solution: No stall needed (forwarding available)

   Instruction: or x9, x1, x10 at PC=0xc
   Depends on: mul x1, x7, x8 (PC=0x8)

   Note: Hazard resolved by separation or forwarding
   Description: RAW Hazard: Read-after-Write on x1
   Solution: No stall needed (forwarding available)
