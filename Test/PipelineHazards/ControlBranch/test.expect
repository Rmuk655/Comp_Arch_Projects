=== Critical Hazards (Stalls > 0) ===
   Instruction: beq x1, x4, target at PC=0x4
   Stall cycles: 2
   Description: Control hazard from Branch instruction: beq
   Solution: Use branch prediction or delayed branching (2 cycles)


=== Resolved / Non-Critical Hazards ===
   Instruction: beq x1, x4, target at PC=0x4
   Depends on: add x1, x2, x3 (PC=0x0)
   Distance: 1 instruction
   Register: x1   Stall cycles: 0
   Note: Hazard resolved by separation or forwarding
   Description: RAW Hazard: Read-after-Write on x1
   Solution: No stall needed (forwarding available)
