=== Critical Hazards (Stalls > 0) ===
   Instruction: div x8, x6, x1 at PC=0xc
   Depends on: mul x6, x4, x7 (PC=0x8)
   Distance: 1 instruction
   Stall cycles: 2
   Description: Structural hazard: both instructions use Mul/Div Unit
   Solution: Stall pipeline until Mul/Div Unit is available


=== Resolved / Non-Critical Hazards ===
   Instruction: sub x4, x1, x5 at PC=0x4
   Depends on: add x1, x2, x3 (PC=0x0)
   Distance: 1 instruction
   Register: x1   Stall cycles: 0
   Note: Hazard resolved by separation or forwarding
   Description: RAW Hazard: Read-after-Write on x1
   Solution: No stall needed (forwarding available)

   Instruction: div x8, x6, x1 at PC=0xc
   Depends on: add x1, x2, x3 (PC=0x0)
