=== Critical Hazards (Stalls > 0) ===
   Instruction: mulw x4, x5, x6 at PC=0x4
   Depends on: mul x1, x2, x3 (PC=0x0)
   Distance: 1 instruction
   Stall cycles: 2
   Description: Structural hazard: both instructions use Mul/Div Unit
   Solution: Stall pipeline until Mul/Div Unit is available

   Instruction: div x7, x8, x9 at PC=0x8
   Depends on: mulw x4, x5, x6 (PC=0x4)
   Distance: 1 instruction
   Stall cycles: 2
   Description: Structural hazard: both instructions use Mul/Div Unit
   Solution: Stall pipeline until Mul/Div Unit is available

   Instruction: divuw x10, x11, x12 at PC=0xc
   Depends on: div x7, x8, x9 (PC=0x8)
   Distance: 1 instruction
   Stall cycles: 2
   Description: Structural hazard: both instructions use Mul/Div Unit
   Solution: Stall pipeline until Mul/Div Unit is available


=== Resolved / Non-Critical Hazards ===
