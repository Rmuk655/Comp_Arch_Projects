=== Critical Hazards (Stalls > 0) ===
   Instruction: lbu x3, 1(x4) at PC=0x4
   Depends on: ld x1, 0(x2) (PC=0x0)
   Distance: 1 instruction
   Stall cycles: 1
   Description: Structural hazard: both instructions use Memory Access Unit
   Solution: Stall pipeline until Memory Access Unit is available

   Instruction: lhu x5, 2(x6) at PC=0x8
   Depends on: lbu x3, 1(x4) (PC=0x4)
   Distance: 1 instruction
   Stall cycles: 1
   Description: Structural hazard: both instructions use Memory Access Unit
   Solution: Stall pipeline until Memory Access Unit is available

   Instruction: sd x7, 8(x8) at PC=0xc
   Depends on: lhu x5, 2(x6) (PC=0x8)
   Distance: 1 instruction
   Stall cycles: 1
   Description: Structural hazard: both instructions use Memory Access Unit
   Solution: Stall pipeline until Memory Access Unit is available
